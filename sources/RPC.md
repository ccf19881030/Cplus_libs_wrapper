## [rpcgen Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1435/rpcgenpguide-21470/index.html)
rpcgen provides programmers a direct way to write distributed applications. Server procedures can be written in any language that observes procedure-calling conventions. These procedures are linked with the server stub produced by rpcgen to form an executable server program. Client procedures are written and linked in the same way.

This section presents some basic rpcgen programming examples. Refer also to the rpcgen(1) man page.
