## [RFC 1321 - The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html)
## [RFC1321-based (RSA-free) MD5 library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc/)
```cpp
This is a very small C library implementing RFC1321, the MD5 message digest function. Unlike the existing W3C libmd5, it was written from the specifications (not the sample code) in RFC1321, and therefore is not required to acknowledge RSA in any way.
